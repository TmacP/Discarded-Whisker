# Welcome to Discarded Whisker

You can [PLAY Discarded Whisker](https://discarded-whisker.pages.dev/) here. 

This project was created so I could experiment with using Defold. This is a work in progress which is still very early in the prototype phase(right now you, and the ai, can only place a card, and end your turn.). The intention is to be a single player, pixel art, card collecting game. 

Check out my [dev log](https://tristenmacpherson.pages.dev/blog/blog-index) to see what I'm up to.
