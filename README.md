# Welcome to Discarded Whisker

You can [PLAY Discarded Whisker](https://discarded-whisker.pages.dev/) here.

This project was created so I could experiment with using Defold. This is a work in progress still in the prototype phase. The intention is to be a single player, pixel art, card collecting game. 

Check out my [dev log](https://tristenmacpherson.pages.dev/blog/blog-index) to see what I'm up to.
